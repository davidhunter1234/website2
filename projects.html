                "Initially a project to feed my biking hobby but introduced me into several new and valuable experiences. It was my first encounter with an arduino and its fascinating selection of components to choose from. I fiddled with its coding language which was intuitive and seamlessly tied together the components. “Is a breadboard some kind of food?”, I thought. That was another first for me and I think that they are quite handy. 
                I am pleasantly pleased with how MACH001 came out to be and I hope this is just the beginning of many projects to come. Next time, I want to integrate soldering for a strong connection and 3D printing for a robust and aesthetic housing for the components."</div>
